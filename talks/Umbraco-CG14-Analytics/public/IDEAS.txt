*      Show the analytics tool we are going to analyse
		WHAT is it?
*        This is Analytics for Umbraco (HTML5 Video loop or gif?)

*        Why did I build it?
*          Morten C's one no longer developed or supported in Umbraco
*          Google dropped older API version (now requires oAuth)
*          To learn how to build & deliver custom solutions for clients

*        Why you too should be delivering hand crafted solutions!
*        Build custom solutions to your client
*          Not just pick & choose default ones

*          With power of Angular craft & custom build property editors to suit their workflow
*          Or custom sections to keep them in one system, so they can manage
*          support tickets or view CRM data

*          Remember to consider their needs & requirments, no two clients are the same

*          Your goal as a developer to make the client or content editor or umbraco user's
*          life pain free and help them with content entry.

*          Re-assert point with an example
				NEED TO THINK OF AN EXAMPLE

*          Help add business value to the client & make their lifes easier


*        Enough Theory Talk - Let's Analyse this & Understand how was built
*        By re-building this together

*        Start with empty Umbraco 7
*          Build up simple analytics section


*        Demo
*          Show how to create section
*          Summary of code in slide
*          Note slide: Remmeber to add your section to your user
*        Demo
*          Show how to create custom tree
*          Summary of code in slide
*        Demo
*          Show custom view/editor on the right
*          Summary of code after


*        Summary at End
*          Angular HEARTS Umbraco
*           List out why perfect fit (Easy to extend, front end dev & little to no C#)
*          Deliver custom handcrafted solutions (HAMMER ICON or similar)
*            Your clients will love you forever
*            Come back to you time & time again, as you save them time with tedious tasks
*
